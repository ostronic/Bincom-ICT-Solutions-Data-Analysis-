## How to Use the Updated Files:
1.  Save Both Files: Place both t_shirt_analysis.py and db_config.json in the same directory.

2.  Edit db_config.json: Open the db_config.json file and replace the placeholder values ("your_db_name", "your_username", etc.) with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script from your terminal:

Bash
```
    git clone https://github.com/ostronic/Bincom-ICT-Solutions-Data-Analysis.git
    cd Bincom-ICT-Solutions-Data-Analysis/
    pip -r install requirements.txt
    python t_shirt_analysis.py
```
4.  **Follow the Prompts:**
* The script will first ask you for the path to the HTML file you want to analyze.
* It will then ask you to enter a number for the recursive search algorithm.

These changes make your script more robust, reusable, and secure. Let me know if you have any other questions! make a pull request.
